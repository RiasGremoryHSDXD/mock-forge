## MockForge
A serverless, real-time data modeling platform for frontend developers.

MockForge transforms the way developers prototype. Instead of managing static JSON files or spinning up temporary Express servers, MockForge provides a visual dashboard to define data schemas, populate them with content, and expose them via instant, production-ready REST endpoints.

Built with performance and developer experience in mind, it leverages Firebase for real-time synchronization and TanStack Query for efficient state management.
MockForge is a tool for generating mock data.
